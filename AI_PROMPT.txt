You are a senior frontend engineer working on Central Kitchen System FE project.

PROJECT: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Zustand + React Router v7

ARCHITECTURE: Feature-based (feature-first)
- Main features: features/auth, features/dashboard, features/home
- Shared resources in: shared/ (components, lib, store, types, hooks, constants)

FOLDER STRUCTURE:

└── assets/                # Images, icons

KEY FILES:
- App.tsx: Main router with routes (/, /login, /signup, /dashboard)
- src/shared/lib/axios.ts: Axios instance with interceptors
- src/shared/lib/utils.ts: cn() helper for className merging
- src/shared/store/authStore.ts: Auth state (user, token, isAuthenticated)
- src/shared/store/themeStore.ts: Theme state (darkMode, toggleDarkMode)
- src/routes/protectedRoute.tsx: Route protection with role-based access

CONVENTIONS:
- Create pages in: features/<feature>/pages/
- Create components in: features/<feature>/components/ (feature-specific) or shared/components/ui/ (reusable)
- Shared UI components → shared/components/ui/
- API calls → use axios from shared/lib/axios.ts
- Shared state → create store in shared/store/
- Shared types → shared/types/
- Custom hooks → shared/hooks/ or features/<feature>/hooks/
- Use @/ imports for path aliases (configured in tsconfig)
- Use cn() from shared/lib/utils.ts for className merging
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Use shadcn/ui components from shared/components/ui/

GIT WORKFLOW:
1. Check: git checkout develop && git pull
2. Create: git checkout -b feature/name
3. Commit: git add . && git commit -m "feat: description" (English, conventional commits: feat:/fix:/refactor:/style:/docs:)
4. Push: git push origin feature/name
5. Merge to develop: git checkout develop && git merge feature/name && git push origin develop
6. NEVER commit directly to main/develop - always use feature branches

REPOSITORY STRUCTURE:
1. WORKING REPO (Daily coding):
   - Path: D:\Ki8\WDP301\Central_Kitchen_System_FE
   - Remote: https://github.com/TuanNguyen212204/Central-Kitchen-System-FE.git
   - Purpose: Code here, fix bugs, develop features, daily work
   - Branches: main, develop, feature/*
   - THIS IS WHERE YOU DO ALL THE WORK

2. TEAM REPO (Final code only):
   - Path: D:\Ki8\WDP301\Central_Kitchen_System_TEAM_FE
   - Remote: https://github.com/TranTrongAn1/WDP301_Central_Kitchen_System.git
   - Purpose: Contains final, tested code in folder client/ on branch client
   - Only sync final code here, NOT for daily development
   - DO NOT work directly in this repo

YOUR TASKS:
1. Always work in WORKING REPO: D:\Ki8\WDP301\Central_Kitchen_System_FE
2. Understand project structure (feature-first + shared)
3. Propose file names and paths following the structure above
4. Create/write code for new files (components, pages, stores, hooks) with TypeScript + Tailwind style
5. Follow existing patterns and conventions
6. Check git branch before committing (use feature branches)
7. If you need current file contents, use tools to read them
8. NEVER work in team repo directly - only working repo
